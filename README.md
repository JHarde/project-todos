# Project Todos

This is a Todo-app in which the user can type down tasks and then check/uncheck them and remove them from the list. The app is built with, React and Redux.

## The problem

I faced some problems with keeping the app from rendering when pressing the refresh site button. I'm currently looking into how to handle that.
